# funko_collection_app
This app is designed to store all of your favorite funko pops as well as  keep track of the ones your  looking to buy. You can add an image with the value name the collection it is in as well as what kind of pop it is. Same as well on your wishlist.

I designed this app with node js mondo database and  it  is deployed on heroku. I have also made this app responsive so you can take the experience with you on the go! I'm a huge fan of funko and a collector myself this is a great way to keep track of your wishlist and collection.

No install needed just head to the site and have fun eventually I will have a login portion to really keep your own collection private and in your control.

Note: Work on responsive portion of site needs work...
Issues: the background images don't line up the best way possible when you shrink the screen an issue I haven't been able to solve.
